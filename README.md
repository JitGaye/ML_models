# ML_models
this has different machine learning models used in this project

We have 3 machine learning models 

## 1. leaf disease detection:
 we used data set form kaggle which has 8 differnt disease classes 
 we used CNN detection
 
 ## 2. finding NPK values:
  you can input the picture of the soil and it will tell the probabilty of it being a type of soil from 5 different classes 
  
## 3. crop recomendation:
  based on your location and we get the humidity, rain fall and temperature and we predict the crop you can grow, the fertilizer you can use for the maximum yield
